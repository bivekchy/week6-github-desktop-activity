# Week 6 GitHub Desktop Activity

This repository contains the C# program from a previous lab exercise, now managed using GitHub Desktop as part of Week 6 activity.

## Program Description

The program simulates registrations for the Tigers Soccer Club. It:
- Accepts the number of registrations and number of players per registration (1–4).
- Collects player details: name, registration type (`kids` or `adults`), and jersey choice (`yes`/`no`).
- Calculates individual player costs based on type and jersey selection.
- Outputs a summary showing:
  - Each player's details and cost
  - The highest and lowest spenders
  - The grand total of all registrations

## How to Run

1. Open the `.cs` file in Visual Studio or another C# IDE.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Follow the prompts in the console.

## Changes Made for Task 4

- Fixed typo: "Tigers Scoccer Club" → "Tigers Soccer Club".
- Corrected loop for min/max cost calculation to iterate over all registered players, not just players per registration.
